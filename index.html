            On the Podcast SharkBite, I and a group of my peers sunk our teeth into discussing discrepancies between audience scores and critics' scores. Then we discussed several questions as to why we should even care about what movie critics have to say. What do you think? Should we listen to snobby critics who only care about Oscar-winning movies? Or is there some value to what they say? Our <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jackson-medina-720519709/shark-bitez-bite-1" target="_blank">podcast episode</a> will let you know what us Sharks think.

            This (link video here when done) short video really tested my editing skills as well as my creativity. I tried to encompass the idea that a regular day at university can be very repetitive and take time away from things you enjoy or do for your own pleasure. However, there are dozen of moments in the day where you can really slow things down for yourself and make time for those things that fill your cup back up so that you can keep going with your day. For me, that activity is crocheting as it forces me to slow down and focus on the task at hand and stops my mind from wandering!   </p>

            During my first semester, I took a creative writing course. One of our writing peices had to be a fiction peice since I am someone who had never written a fiction peice, I was very worried. The weekend before class, I had taken a walk through the Duck Pond where there are dozens of willow trees. The way their branches droop into the water is gorgeous to see any time of day. I knew I wanted my peice to be in the perspective of a willow tree I just didn't know where I wanted to take the story. The story took quite a dramatic turn here and there but for (anchor text) my first fiction peice, I am surprisingly proud.     </p>
